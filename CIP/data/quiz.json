      "feedback": "Correct! The <strong>Belmont Report</strong> defines respect for persons as treating individuals as autonomous agents and protecting those with diminished autonomy. This principle requires that participation in research be <strong>voluntary</strong> and based on <strong>adequate information</strong> - the foundation of informed consent requirements in 45 CFR 46.116."

      "feedback": "Correct! A poorly designed protocol is unethical because any risks or burdens to participants cannot be justified if the research is unlikely to yield valid, meaningful knowledge. Even minimal risks or inconveniences become unreasonable when the knowledge gained is weak or unreliable. This reflects 45 CFR 46.111(a)(2), which requires that risks to subjects be reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits (if any) and the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result."

Under <strong>45 CFR 46.113</strong>, an IRB has the authority to suspend or terminate approval when research is not being conducted in accordance with IRB requirements or has been associated with unexpected serious harm. The IRB does not need permission from attorneys or institutional officials to exercise this authority when participant safety is at stake."
